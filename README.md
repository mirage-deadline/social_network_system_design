# System design for social network

Homework for the [System Design course](https://google.com)


## Requirements

--- 

### Functional requirements
- Posts publishing (posts include text, img, geo)
- Get posts
- Follow/Unfollow travelers
- Interact with others (ratings/comments on posts)
- Discover popular spots and view related posts
- View feeds (personal & followed) in reverse chronological order
---


### Non-functional requirements
- DAU = 10kk (linear growth)
- Audience (Regional Focus): CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)
- Always store data (no data is ever purged)
- 99.95% availability
- Geo distribution is not needed
- Limits:
  - Max number of followers: 1kk
- Typical Activities (per user):
  - Posts: 
    - publish 1 post per week
    - view feeds 3 times per day (each feed request loads ~15 posts)
  - Comments:
    - 3 comments per week (write)
    - read comments of any 2 posts daily(each comment request loads ~5 comments)
  - Ratings:
    - 5 ratings per day
    - View 8 ratings per day
  - Spots:
    - 1 time per week view popular spots
- Performance (Timing):
  - Create a post: ≤ 1s
  - Comment on a post: ≤ 1s
  - Search posts by geo: ≤ 2s
  - Load the feed: ≤ 2s
- Seasonality. Usage spikes expected during peak travel/holiday seasons (e.g., summer vacations, winter holidays), with a possible **30-40% increase** in daily activity (posts, comments, feed views). The system must handle these peaks while maintaining performance and availability targets

## Calculation

### Posts

```
RPS(write) = 10kk * 1 post per week / 7 / 86400 ~= 17
RPS(read) = 10kk * 3 time per day view feeds(15 posts) / 86400 ~= 350
```

### Comments

```
RPS(write) = 10kk * 3 comments per week / 7 / 86400 ~= 50
RPS(read) = 10kk * 2 time per day read comments(5 comments) / 86400 ~= 231
```

### Ratings

```
RPS(write) = 10kk * 5 ratings per day / 86400 ~= 600
RPS(read) = 10kk * 8 ratings per day / 86400 ~= 925

```

### Spots

```
RPS(read) = 10kk * 1 time per week view popular spots / 7 / 86400 ~= 20
```


## AVG size of data
#### Post:
- id (8 bytes)
- author_id (8 bytes)
- text (up to 500 bytes)
- img (up to 1MB)
- geo (up to 100 bytes)
- created_at (8 bytes)

**Total**: 8B + 8B + 500B + 1MB + 100B + 8B ~= 1MB

---
#### Comment:
- id (8 bytes)
- post_id (8 bytes)
- author_id (8 bytes)
- text (up to 250 bytes)
- created_at (8 bytes)

**Total**: 8B + 8B + 8B + 250B + 8B ~= 300B

---

#### Rating:
- id (8 bytes)
- post_id (8 bytes)
- author_id (8 bytes)
- value INT8 (1 byte)
- created_at (8 bytes)

**Total** 8B + 8B + 8B + 1B + 8B ~= 33B

--- 

## Traffic

### Posts

```
Metainformation = id + author_id + text + geo + img_url + created_at = 8 + 8 + 500 + 100 + 8 = 624B ~= 0.6KB
Media = img = 1MB

Traffic (write, meta) = 17 * 0.6KB ~= 10KB/s
Traffic (write, media) = 17 * 1MB ~= 17MB/s
Traffic (read, meta) = 350 * 15 * 0.6Kb ~= 3.1MB/s
Traffic (read, media) = 350 * 15 * 1MB ~= 5.15GB/s
```

### Comments

```
Traffic (write) = 50 * 300B = 15KB/s
Traffic (read) = 231 * 5 * 300B = 338KB/s
```

### Ratings

```
Traffic (write) = 600 * 33B = 20KB/s
Traffic (read) = 925 * 33B = 30KB/s
```

**For the peak load, we need to add 40% to the calculated values.**


## Disks evaluation for 1 year

### Posts

total rps = 17 + 350 = 367

#### Meta

capacity = 10KB/s * 86400 * 365 ~= 300GB

HDD:
- disks for iops
  - 367 / 100 iops ~= 4 disks
- disks for throughput
  - 10KB/s / 100mb/s = 1 disk
- discs for capacity
  - 300GB / 1TB = 1 disk
- Total disks: max(4, 1, 1) = 4 disks

SSD(SATA)
- disks for iops
  - 367 / 1000 iops ~= 1 disk
- disks for throughput
  - 10KB/s / 500mb/s = 1 disk
- discs for capacity
  - 300GB / 1TB = 1 disk
- Total disks: max(1, 1, 1) = 1 disk

SSD(NVMe)
- disks for iops
  - 367 / 10000 iops ~= 1 disk
